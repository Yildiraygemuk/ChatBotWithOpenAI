<p>I designed this project to perform text generation and chat operations using the ChatGPT language model. Using an OpenAI-trained language model, the project generates the meaning of texts entered by users or answers to questions. I designed this project using .Net 7 technology.
</p>
<p>The project can be an important resource for developers who want to do research in language learning and text production, or who want to build chat applications.
</p>
<p>In the project, the text production processes using the ChatGPT language model are carried out over the REST API interface. In this way, the project can be easily integrated between different platforms and applications.
</p>
<p>The project can be an important resource for developers who want to advance in language learning and text production, or who want to create chat applications.
</p>
<p>You can build the project by running the following command in the command prompt:</p>
</p>

```
docker build -t chatbotwithopenai -f Dockerfile .
```
<p>And then you can run the project by running the following command:</p>

```
docker run -ti --rm -p 5000:80 chatbotwithopenai
```

<p>This will run the project on port 5000 on your local machine.</p>
